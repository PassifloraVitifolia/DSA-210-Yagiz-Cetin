# Airbnb Prices and Crime Rates Analysis
## Project Overview
This project is about the relationship between **Airbnb prices and crime rates** in various locations. My goal is to determine that how crime levels impact guest preferences hence the hospitality prices. I will achieve this goal by comparing the data from Airbnb in high and low-crime areas.
## Data Sources

**- Public Datasets:** Using government crime databases for official statistics.

**- Social Media Analysis:** Collecting mentions of Airbnb and crime reports.


## Technology Stack
**- Programming Language:** Python 

**- Libraries & Tools:**

## Goals & Expected Outcomes
**-**  Identify correlation/causation between Airbnb prices and crime rates.

**-** Analyze guest reviews to determine crime-related concerns. (Causation check)

**-** Compare pricing strategies across hospitality services.

**-** Create a visualised data for providing insights for hosts and travelers regarding crime-affected areas.
